<h2 >Introduction</h2>
<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web. </p>
<p>Founded in 1994 and led by <a href="lthree.html">Tim Berners-Lee</a>>, the consortium is made up of member organizations that maintain full-time staff working together in the development of standards for the World Wide Web.
 As of 5 March 2023, W3C had 462 members.W3C also engages in education and outreach, develops software and serves as an open forum for discussion about the Web.
 The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) is an international organization that creates standards for the World Wide Web. The WC3 is committed to improving the web by setting and promoting web-based standards.</p>

 <h2>History</h2>
 <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October 1994. It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Laboratory for Computer Science with support from the European Commission, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which had pioneered the ARPANET, one of the predecessors to the Internet. It was located in Technology Square until 2004, when it moved, with the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, to the Stata Center.</p>
 <p>The organization tries to foster compatibility and agreement among industry members in the adoption of new standards defined by the W3C. Incompatible versions of HTML are offered by different vendors, causing inconsistency in how web pages are displayed. The consortium tries to get all those vendors to implement a set of core principles and components that are chosen by the consortium.</p>
 <p>It was originally intended that CERN host the European branch of W3C; however, CERN wished to focus on particle physics, not information technology. In April 1995, the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation became the European host of W3C, with Keio University Research Institute at SFC becoming the Asian host in September 1996.Starting in 1997, W3C created regional offices around the world. As of September 2009, it had eighteen World Offices covering Australia, the Benelux countries (Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg), Brazil, China, Finland, Germany, Austria, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Israel, Italy, South Korea, Morocco, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and, as of 2016, the United Kingdom and Ireland.</p>

 <h2>Specification maturation</h2>
 <p>W3C develops technical specifications for <strong> HTML5, CSS, SVG, WOFF, the Semantic Web stack, XML</strong>, 
 and other technologies. Sometimes, when a specification becomes too large, 
 it is split into independent modules that can mature at their own pace.</P> 
 <p>Subsequent editions of a module or specification are known as levels and are denoted by the first integer in the title (e.g. CSS3 = Level 3). Subsequent revisions on 
 each level are denoted by an integer following a decimal point (for example, CSS2.1 = Revision 1).
The W3C standard formation process is defined within the W3C process document, 
outlining four maturity levels through which each new standard or recommendation must progress.</p>

 <h2 id="WD">Working Draft(WD)</h2>
 <p>After enough content has been gathered from 'editor drafts' and discussion, it may be published as a working draft (WD) for review by the community. A WD document is the first form of a standard that is publicly available. Commentary by virtually anyone is accepted, though no promises are made with regard to action on any particular element commented upon.
At this stage, the standard document may have significant differences from its final form. As such, anyone who implements WD standards should be ready to significantly modify their implementations as the standard matures.After enough content has been gathered from 'editor drafts' and discussion, it may be published as a working draft (WD) for review by the community.

<h2 id="CR">Candidate recommendation (CR)</h2>
<p>A candidate recommendation is a version of a standard that is more mature than the WD. At this point, the group responsible for the standard is satisfied that the standard meets its goal. The purpose of the CR is to elicit aid from the development community as to how implementable the standard is.
The standard document may change further, but at this point, significant features are mostly decided. The design of those features can still change due to feedback from implementors.A candidate recommendation is a version of a standard that is more mature than the WD.

<h2 id="PR">Proposed recommendation (PR)</h2>
<p>A proposed recommendation is the version of a standard that has passed the prior two levels. The users of the standard provide input. At this stage, the document is submitted to the W3C Advisory Council for final approval.
While this step is important, it rarely causes any significant changes to a standard as it passes to the next phase.A proposed recommendation is the version of a standard that has passed the prior two levels.

<br>

<h2 id="REC">W3C recommendation (REC)</h2>
<p>This is the most mature stage of development. At this point, the standard has undergone extensive review and testing, under both theoretical and practical conditions. The standard is now endorsed by the W3C, indicating its readiness for deployment to the public, and encouraging more widespread support among implementors and authors.
Recommendations can sometimes be implemented incorrectly, partially, or not at all, but many standards define two or more levels of conformance that developers must follow if they wish to label their product as W3C-compliant.This is the most mature stage of development.

<h2 id="L">Later revisions</h2>
<p>A recommendation may be updated or extended by separately-published, non-technical errata or editor drafts until sufficient substantial edits accumulate for producing a new edition or level of the recommendation. Additionally, the W3C publishes various kinds of informative notes which are to be used as references
